# McGill-Honours-Thesis
This is collection of code from my undergraduate honours thesis from the Mechanical Engineering Department at McGill University. It performs numerical simulations of spacecraft flying in formation in low Earth orbit subject to J2 and aerodynamic drag perturbations. My adviser was Prof. Arun K. Misra and this work was undertaken in the Space Flight Dynamics Lab in 2009.
